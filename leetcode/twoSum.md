# Two approaches

1. Fixed the intuition behind the nested for loop and comparing all elements. 
2. Then looked at the two pointers solution. remember, two pointer for two sum is on both ends. 
3. Found out that it only works for postive values. 
4. Need to look the solution when it is not sorted. They use hashmaps. Also, review hashmaps.
